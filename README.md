## Text fonts
To make text cursive, put stars (*) or underslining on both sides of the word/sentance
Example:*this is what it would look like* or _like this_

To make text bold, put double starts on both sides of whatever you are writing or double underline
Example:**this is what it would look like** or __like this__

Alternative ways of making text cursive of bold exists so we can combine both of the ways.For example _text can be cursive and **half bold** at the same time_

## Lists
To make a bulleted list add (*) in front of a sentance, example will look like this:
* Point 1
* Point 2

To make a numbered lists add number and dot in front of the sentence like this: 
1. Point 1
2. Point 3
